# Hi! I'm Alejandro Marquino :grinning: :grinning: 
=============================

Junior Developer. After 15 years working in logistics :articulated_lorry: and imports :ship: sector providing solutions to my clients for their projects, I decided to reconvert myself as a Software Developer :computer:. 

Passionate about technology and business, I have been studying and preparing myself in various Bootcamps and also developing my own projects. Some of the technologies that I love are Python, JavaScript, and HTML5 + CSS.

But that is not all! :tada: I love communication and the creation of video and audio content :movie_camera: a passion that I have developed since 2014 producing, directing and presenting various podcasts :microphone: about video games and entertainment! Do not leave my profile without checking them out!!
